    <h2>Marc's Products:</h2>
    <br>
    Almost to a fault, i fix everything and keep it working after most others would replace it. So, in general i don't
    think of myself as a big consumer. However, there are a few products i really like, many of which help me keep me
    and my
    stuff ticking...
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2>Alexa Home Automation related:</h2><br>I've found the following items useful and fun in automating my
            home
            via seamless integration into the Amazon Alexa ecosystem.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Several <a href="https://amzn.to/4fuHlHu" target="_blank">Kasa Smart Plugs</a> which allow you to say
                "Alexa, turn on the
                <a href="https://amzn.to/3ybZadR" target="_blank">TubeAmp</a>" (which the <a
                    href="https://amzn.to/4fuHFWI" target="_blank">Amazon Echo Dot</a> has a BT
                connection to, enabling great HiFi stereo via which you can play
                PrimeMusic-- included w/your AmazonPrime subscription, Pandora, Spotify, etc in your home), and "Alexa,
                turn on the <a href="https://amzn.to/46sVVeq" target="_blank">Mr. Coffee</a> at 6:15a" after you've
                setup the coffee pot the evening before.
            </li>
            <li>Several <a href="https://amzn.to/3WW02Nj" target="_blank">Kasa Smart Light Switches</a> which allow you
                to say
                "Alexa, turn on the DenLight", to set the porch light to go on at Sunset & off at Sunrise, via a timer
                rule, and allowing "Alexa, after 15min turn off the BathroomFan" when you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>A <a href="https://amzn.to/4dqbG8a" target="_blank">TREATLIFE Smart Ceiling Fan Control and light
                    dimmer</a> which allow you
                to say "Alexa, turn on the CeilingFan"</li>
            <li>A <a href="https://amzn.to/3WLCfiQ" target="_blank">Sengled Smart LED multicolor bulb</a> which allow
                you to say "Alexa, turn on the MagicLight" or "Alexa, MagicLight 20%" or "Alexa, MagicLight red"</li>
            <li>A <a href="https://amzn.to/3YuiBcm" target="_blank">Refoss Smart WiFi Garage Door Opener</a> which allow
                you to say "Alexa, close the garage door" or to open/close it from your phone.</li>
            <li>A <a href="https://amzn.to/4ccKDMG" target="_blank">Fire TV Stick 4k</a> so you can cut the cord and
                have voice command over your existing set... or if you're due for a new TV, perhaps the <a
                    href="https://amzn.to/4flqWVX" target="_blank">65" Omni Series 4K UHD smart TV</a> or the <a
                    href="https://amzn.to/3WwiZo6" target="_blank">55" Omni QLED Series 4K UHD smart TV</a>.</li>
            <li>A <a href="https://amzn.to/4cVDxNT" target="_blank">Sharp ZSMC1469HS Microwave Oven</a> which allow
                you to say "Alexa, microwave my frozen peas for 5min." fwiw, not saying you should buy a new microwave
                SO that you can say that, however if you were going to get a new microwave this might fit the bill, and
                the home automation theme. It does keep its time in sync (and resets time after power failures)-- so you
                can really use it as a kitchen clock on school days. I find it actually works quite well, though i do
                get some side eye from other
                family members when speak to the micro... <br>
                I have a Samsung (Model #NE63BG8315SS) stovetop/oven in the kitchen as well, and can similarly
                turn on/off the oven light via Alexa, along w/keeping its clock sync'ed.<br>
                Ahh... the IoT. Yeah... the Internet, it's gonna be big someday.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Go Bucket for the Truck</h2><br>Some gotta-have-it gear when heading out... i keep them it in a 2.5gal
            bucket i bring with me in <a href="53ChevPU.htm">the truck</a> like a portable glovebox:

            <h2>Other tools you should probably have on hand, or otherwise around the house</h2><br>Some items for the
            garage
            bench, your wrist, on or
            under your
            counter, etc. I'll leave it to you when and where you use them.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>An inexpensive yet decent <a href="https://amzn.to/4dp16hX" target="_blank">multimeter</a> (i have a
                similar, earlier
                model. It often travels with me in the Go Bucket as well). And a no frills <a
                    href="https://amzn.to/4dqIwpB" target="_blank">IR Thermometer</a>, and <a
                    href="https://amzn.to/3E5L544" target="_blank">moisture meter</a>.</li>
            <li>I've also made great use of this <a href=" https://amzn.to/3yq8dYx" target="_blank">Underground
                    wire locator</a> and with it have found 4 separate/buried spinkler valve control boxes with it.</li>
            <li>For you Floridians (or others in warm climates)... if you're going to attempt to maintain your AC units,
                you're going to want <a href="https://amzn.to/46uoWXe" target="_blank">Yellow Jacket Manifold, guages
                    and hoses</a> along with <a href="https://amzn.to/3LOJwIn" target="_blank">Yellow Jacket Mini Ball

                your red/high pressure hose. I'm a fan of these <a href="https://amzn.to/3A7JPLT" target="_blank">5-2-1
                    Compressor Saver kits</a> even proactively when units are new; and as they age, let alone get old,
                you'll probably want to have some <a href="https://amzn.to/3AgC46c" target="_blank">Leak Savers</a>.
            </li>
            <li>An <a href=" https://amzn.to/3WMomkg" target="_blank">Amazfit Band 7</a> (the successor to the

            <h2>Must haves for the nerd bench</h2><br>OK... must haves are an overstatement, though this is some fun
            gear to geek out with.
        </li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <h2>The Commode</h2><br>it deserves its own section.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>I'm a single piece <a href="https://amzn.to/4fup3pR" target="_blank">Toto Ultramax Elongated 1 Piece
                    Toilet MS854114SG#01 Cotton White</a> fan, which should come with a Toto soft close lid.</li>
            <li>Between that lid and the bowl, you should have a simple bidet. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3yvNOBh"
                    target="_blank">LUXE Bidet NEO 185</a> is a good choice in my book.</li>
            <li>A <a href=" https://amzn.to/4frZeH2" target="_blank">motion sensing, color LED night light</a> for the
                bowl is
                entirely
                unnecessary... butt there are far worse ways to flush $5.
            </li>
            <li>Finally, in a more traditional tool sense... to the extent you want or need
                to replace an old, multi-turn gate valve to shutoff supply for your toilet (or sink), in favor of a
                working, <a href="https://amzn.to/42paCPQ" target="_blank">modern 1/4 turn ball valve</a> (maintaining
                OG style internal copper compression fitting),
                and in the process of attempting to reuse the old nut and ferrule find it seeping or worse
                due to mineral deposits or other corrosion needing remediation prior to new refitting...
                you will need a US threaded
                (hard to find-- i bought 2 other tools first which had foreign/metric threads, despite claims to the
                contrary, before settling on this one)
                <a href="https://amzn.to/4h3xclF" target="_blank">1/2" compression fitting nut and
                    ferrule puller</a>. This one is a winner.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <p>These are simply some things i find useful and enjoy putting to use. I've been thinking of hosting a Marc's
        Products
        page for
        years; finally got around to it.<br>Hope you'll find some of them interesting as well.</p>
